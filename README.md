I'm pretty new to C# and Unity modding so there probably some optimizations that could be made or better methods that I could have used.\

# Easy Vanity
This mod does 3 things
- Makes appearance changes at the mirror free
- Makes it free to transmogrify equipment
- Removes the level and class limit for transmogrifying

these can be enable or disabled at will

## Known/Potential Issue
- When unlocked or free transmogrifying is enabled, items that can be used will still be greyed out.
- I have not tested it in multiplayer so idk if it works. (if you do end up testing it, feel free to tell me if it worked)

## TODO
- add hotkey to open appearance menu
- fix greyed out issue
